The skiplink component to help keyboard-only users skip to the main content on a page. To view an example, click within the preview above and press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.

## When to use this component

Almost all pages should utilise the skiplink component.

## When to consider something else

The skiplink component may be omitted on exceptionally short pages that lack a masthead, navigation or other content block prior to the page's main content.

## Guidance

The skiplink component is visually hidden until a keyboard press activates it.

## Accessibility

Some people use the tab key on their keyboard to navigate through the links and form elements on a web page. Including the skiplink component gives users the option to bypass the top-level navigation links and jump to the main content on a page.

Ensure that the colours of the skiplink meets WCAG AA contrast guidelines.

## Browser considerations

None.
